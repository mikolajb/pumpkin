punchd.py is the randevouz server for elab ,etc
punch.py is the simple client that works as a netcat with punchd.py

Basically I'm trying to integrate punch.py into TftpServer

TftpMessageQueue is an experiment trying to convert Tftp to work as a message queue instead of files....
TftpServer  open() is the replacement of the traditional listen()
TftpContext is where the datafile transfer is handled 

p2pserver.py should be the server side test
p2pclient.py should be the client side test
